          <p>The Instructor Dashboard in Skillable TMS was heavily based on feedback and usage patterns.

          <h2>Optimization without changes</h2>
          <p>I played a key role in development at Finish Line, where I consistently sought out opportunities for improvement. One of the 
            critical areas I tackled was optimizing the product page, which had become burdened with unnecessary code over time, leading 
            to sluggish loading times and a subpar user experience. By meticulously rebuilding the page while retaining its original design, 
            I streamlined the codebase, eliminated redundancies, and ensured seamless compatibility between desktop and mobile views. As a 
            result, the revamped product page now loads 50% faster, enhancing user satisfaction and driving improved performance metrics for 
            the company.</p>

          <h2>Shopping Locally</h2>
          <p>During the early stages of the pandemic, Finish Line identified a crucial need to empower customers with the ability to conveniently
            search their local store's inventory for same-day pickupâ€”a vital service amid evolving health and safety concerns. Although this 
            functionality could be categorized as a filter, I advocated for treating it as a distinct feature due to its strategic importance 
            and unique user experience implications.</p>
          <p>The successful deployment of this feature not only addressed an urgent customer need but also positioned Finish Line as a 
            forward-thinking and customer-centric brand during a challenging period. Our efforts culminated in tangible benefits, including 
            increased customer satisfaction, heightened brand loyalty, and enhanced operational efficiency for the company.</p>

            social media posts. With a simple lasso gesture on the map interface, users could effortlessly uncover relevant posts within

          <p>This innovative tool empowered users to create personalized alerts tailored to their specific needs and preferences. By offering 
            customizable parameters and immediate actionability, the alert wizard streamlined the process of monitoring and responding to 
            relevant social media content, ultimately amplifying the platform's effectiveness and utility for users.</p>

          <p>During my tenure at Lids, our operations included managing a series of team-specific online shops. Despite offering the same merchandise as the main website, these specialized sites garnered significant attention from fans seeking tailored experiences.</p>
          <p>The designs were meticulously crafted to integrate seamlessly within a component-based framework, while simultaneously reflecting the distinct visual identity of each affiliated organization.</p>
