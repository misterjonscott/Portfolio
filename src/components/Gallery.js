        <GalleryTextContainer>
          <p>The Instructor Dashboard in Skillable TMS was heavily based on feedback and usage patterns. We enhanced efficiency by providing instructors with quick access to essential session-related information, freeing them to concentrate on their students rather than administrative tasks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Quick Links section in the top left offers convenient navigation to the most frequently accessed pages in Skillable TMS.</li>
            <li>
              Tools and information related to each session are available via a tabbed interface that also displays the most regularly requested session-specific information.</li>
            <li>
              The week-at-a-glance view helps the instructor plan their week.  Selecting a session from this interface will open that session's details in a new tab.</li>
            <li>
              The month-at-a-glance feature allows a broad view, with simple navigation through time, and displays the current date, blocked days, and icons to signify scheduled sessions.</li>

      <h2>Optimization without changes</h2>
      <GalleryContent>
        <GalleryTextContainer>
          <p>I played a key role in development at Finish Line, where I consistently sought out opportunities for improvement. One of the 
            critical areas I tackled was optimizing the product page, which had become burdened with unnecessary code over time, leading 
            to sluggish loading times and a subpar user experience. By meticulously rebuilding the page while retaining its original design, 
            I streamlined the codebase, eliminated redundancies, and ensured seamless compatibility between desktop and mobile views. As a 
            result, the revamped product page now loads 50% faster, enhancing user satisfaction and driving improved performance metrics for 
            the company.</p>

        <GalleryTextContainer>
          <p>During the early stages of the pandemic, Finish Line identified a crucial need to empower customers with the ability to conveniently
            search their local store's inventory for same-day pickupâ€”a vital service amid evolving health and safety concerns. Although this 
            functionality could be categorized as a filter, I advocated for treating it as a distinct feature due to its strategic importance 
            and unique user experience implications.</p>
          <p>The successful deployment of this feature not only addressed an urgent customer need but also positioned Finish Line as a 
            forward-thinking and customer-centric brand during a challenging period. Our efforts culminated in tangible benefits, including 
            increased customer satisfaction, heightened brand loyalty, and enhanced operational efficiency for the company.</p>
